# Reepolee Application Starter

This is a starter template we are using here at [Reepolee](https://www.reepolee.com) to write web apps in Svelte. Routify is added for file-based routing and mdsvex is taking care of Markdown files. Using Vite as dev server, final builds are offloaded to Rollup.

## Setup

```
npx degit reepolee/routify-starter#main my-app
cd my-app
npm i
npm run dev
```
